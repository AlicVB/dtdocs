The general screen layout of all views is similar and consists of a centre area with panels at the edges. 

center area
: Contains information specific to the current view.

left panel
: Contains modules primarily used to provide information.

right panel
: Contains modules primarily used for image processing.

[top panel](./top-panel.md)
: provide access to view-independent settings and shortcuts

bottom panel
: Provide access to view-specific settings and shortcuts.

[filmstrip](./filmstrip.md)/timeline panel
: An optional panel that can be enabled at the bottom of the screen to display a timeline (in the lighttable view) or a filmstrip (in other views) of images in the current collection.

Each of the panels can be expanded or collapsed by pressing a triangle located at the edge of the panel.

The left, right and filmstrip/timeline panels can be resized by dragging their inner borders. Size and visibility of panels are stored independently for each view.

Panel visibility can also be adjusted using keyboard shortcuts, as follows:

```
TAB             Temporarily expand the centre view to fill the whole window. 
                Press again to return to the previous view.
F11             Toggle fullscreen mode
Shift+Ctrl+t    Toggle the top panel (between the image and the top banner)
Shift+Ctrl+b    Toggle the bottom panel (beween the image and the filmstrip/timeline if shown)
Shift+Ctrl+l    Toggle the left panel
Shift+Ctrl+r    Toggle the right panel
Ctrl+f          Toggle the filmstrip/timeline
Ctrl+h          Toggle the top banner
b               Toggle all borders and panel-collapse controls
```
