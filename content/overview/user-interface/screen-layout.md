The general screen layout of all views is similar and consists of a centre area with panels at the edges. 

center area
: Contains information specific to the current view.

left panel
: Contains modules primarily used to provide information.

right panel
: Contains modules primarily used for image processing.

top and bottom panels
: Provides access to settings and shortcuts.

Each of the panels can be collapsed or expanded by pressing a triangle located at the edge of the panel.

The left, right and filmstrip/timeline panels can be resized by dragging their borders. Size and visibility of panels are stored independently for each view.

Panel visibility can also be toggled using keyboard shortcuts, as follows:

```
TAB             Temporarily expand the centre view to fill the whole window. 
                Press again to return to the previous view.
F11             Toggle fullscreen mode
Shift+Ctrl+t    Show/hide top panel (between the image and the top banner)
Shift+Ctrl+b    Show/hide the bottom panel (beween the image and the filmstrip/timeline)
Shift+Ctrl+l    Show/hide the left panel
Shift+Ctrl+r    Show/hide the right panel
Ctrl+f          Show/hide the filmstrip/timeline
Ctrl+h          Show/hide the top banner
b               Show/hide all borders and panel-collapse controls
```
