The filmstrip displays at the bottom of the screen (except in the lighttable view) and shows the same images as are available in the lighttable view (with respect to filters and sort order). You can navigate along the filmstrip by scrolling with the mouse wheel. 

The filmstrip allows you to interact with images while you are not in the lighttable view. For example, while developing an image in darkroom mode, you can switch to another image to by double clicking its thumbnail in the filmstrip. You can also rate and color-classify the images as you do in lighttable, as well as copy & paste the history stack with keyboard shortcuts.
