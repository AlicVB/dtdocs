Much of the functionality in darktable can be controlled via keyboard shortcuts which can be customised in the _shortcuts_ tab of the _preferences_ dialog. See the [shortcuts](../../preferences-settings/shortcuts.md) section for more details.

Press the 'h' button in any darktable view to show a list of all shortcuts that are applicable to the current view.
