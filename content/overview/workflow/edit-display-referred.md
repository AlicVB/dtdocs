The *display-referred* workflow places emphasis on doing image processing in the non-linear display-referred part of the pixel pipe. It uses the _basecurve_ module to transition into this display-referred space. Where users are used to using this legacy workflow, it can still be used. However, the evolution of darktable is converging around the scene-referred workflow, and we would encourage our users to explore that option further.
