The _display-referred_ workflow places emphasis on performing image processing in the non-linear display-referred part of the [pixelpipe](../../darkroom/processing-modules-and-pixelpipe/_index.md). It uses the [_base curve_](../../module-reference/processing-modules/base-curve.md) module to transition into this display-referred space. Where users are used to using this legacy workflow, it can still be used. However, the evolution of darktable is converging around scene-referred workflow, and we would encourage our users to explore that option further.
