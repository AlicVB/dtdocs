The slideshow view allows you to view a slideshow of your current collection. Entering the slideshow view will start the slideshow of the images, using the currently selected collection with the associated filtering rules and sort order applied. To learn more on how to define the collection, the filtering and the sort order see Section 2.3.2, “Collect images” and Section 2.2.5, “Filtering and sort order”.

The image display is optimized to take full advantage of your screen size. You should therefore put darktable into fullscreen mode which is toggled by pressing F11. You may press Tab key in order to hide all remaining panels, including the the filtering option in the top panel.

The next section provides more details on the [usage](usage.md) of the slideshow view.
