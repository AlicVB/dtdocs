The slideshow view allows you to watch a slideshow of your current collection. Entering the slideshow view will start the slideshow, using the currently selected collection with the associated filtering rules and sort order applied. To learn more about how to define the collection and filtering rules, see the section on [collections](../lighttable/digital-asset-management/collections.md). Select the sort criteria and sort order of the images in the [top panel](../overview/user-interface/top-panel.md).

The image display is optimized to take full advantage of your screen size. Put darktable into fullscreen mode by pressing F11. Press the Tab key to hide all remaining panels, including the the filtering option in the top panel.

The next section provides more details on the [usage](usage.md) of the slideshow view.
