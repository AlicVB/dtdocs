The slideshow view allows you to view a slideshow of your current collection. Entering the slideshow view will start the slideshow of the images, using the currently selected collection with the associated filtering rules and sort order applied. To learn more on how to define the collection and the associated filtering rules, see the section on [collections](../lighttable/digital-asset-management/collections.md). Select the sort criterion and sort order of the images in the [top panel](../overview/user-interface/top-panel.md).

The image display is optimized to take full advantage of your screen size. Put darktable into fullscreen mode which is toggled by pressing _F11_. Press the _Tab_ key in order to hide all remaining panels, including the the filtering option in the top panel.

The next section provides more details on the [usage](usage.md) of the slideshow view.
