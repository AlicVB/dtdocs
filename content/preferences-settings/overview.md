darktable comes with a number of user-configurable preferences. These can be adjusted in the preferences dialog, which can be reached by clicking the gear icon on the right of the [top panel](../overview/user-interface/top-panel.md).

Any altered settings (i.e. those that differ from their default state) are highlighted. Double click on a setting's label to reset to the default value.
