darktable comes with a number of user-configurable preferences. These can be adjusted in the preferences dialog, which can be reached by clicking the gear icon on the right of the [top panel](../overview/user-interface/top-panel.md).

Non-default setting values are highlighted for easy spotting. Double click on setting label resets setting to default.
