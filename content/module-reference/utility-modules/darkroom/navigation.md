On the top left hand side the navigation panel displays a full preview of your image with a rectangle showing the currently visible zoom area in the central panel. Drag the rectangle around to pan the zoomed-in view. The current zoom scale is displayed to the right of the preview image. Click on that figure for a quick access to some common zoom levels.

The navigation panel can be toggled on/off with a keyboard shortcut (_Ctrl+Shift+n_ by default).
