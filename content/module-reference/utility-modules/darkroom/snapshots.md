A snapshot is stored as a bitmap of the current center view and is kept as long as you stay in the darkroom. A snapshot can then be selected and overlaid in the current center view to help you with a side by side comparison (by default left=snapshot, right=active edit) when you are tuning parameters of a module. This can also be combined with _history stack_ module to compare the snapshot against different stages of development. 

You can control the split view by moving the splitline back and forth over the image. If you hover with the mouse over the splitline, a small rotation icon will appear on the center of the line. Click it to change between vertical and horizontal split view. 

At all times, an arrow containing the letter "S" is displayed to indicate which side of the image is the snapshot and which is the current edit.
