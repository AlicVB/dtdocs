Control the visibility of darktable's image processing modules.

By default only a standard set of modules is shown to the user. The _more modules_ module can be used to make additional modules visible, or to hide modules that you don't typically use.

Each module is shown with a small icon next to its name. Left-click with your mouse to toggle a module's status between _visible_, _hidden_ and _favourite_. Favourite modules are indicated by a star in front of the icon and, in addition to appearing in their normal module group, will also be visible in the _favourites_ module group. This allows for fast access to modules that you use frequently. Visible modules are indicated in the list by a light grey background whilst hidden modules have a dark grey background and do not display any of their controls.

Hiding or un-hiding modules is not meant to be part of your daily workflow and you should only occasionally need to review the modules you typically use. However, you may store various settings at your choice as presets for later reuse.

A number of presets are provided reflecting common workflows. Note that selecting any of the provided presets will override your current settings. If you wish to revert back to a previous state make sure you first save your current settings as a preset.

Please note that hidden modules may still be activated by using the 'module search' facility.
