The duplicate manager lists all versions of the current darkroom image with their preview thumbnails. Single click on a thumbnail to temporarily show the related version in the center view. Double click to switch to this version and edit it. 

The buttons on the top-right allow you to create new duplicates. Either a 'virgin' version with an empty history stack, or an exact duplicate of the current image. For your convenience, you can also assign a name to each version.

The displayed name is stored in the "version name" metadata tag, which can also be edited within the _metadata editor_ module.
