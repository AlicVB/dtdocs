Select preferred map data from various providers. Some will provide additional layers (satellite view etc.) which you can toggle.

# module controls

map source
: Choose the provider to source map information from.

max polygon points
: The [find location](/../find-location.md) module doesn't display polygon larger than this value for performance reason. Usually a country polygon counts between 50.000 and 150.000 points.

show OSD
: Choose whether to display the OSD controls on top-left of the center view.

filtered images
: Select to display only the images from the filmstrip in the center view. De-select to display all images in the current library, where those images have GPS data associated with them. You can also toggle this option by pressing Ctrl+S.

max images
: Controls the maximum number of displayed thumbnails.

group size factor
: Increase or decrease the size of the area that causes images to be grouped.

min images per group
: The minimum number of images that need to be placed in the same position in order to automatically create an image group for them.

thumbnail display
: Three options are available: image thumbnail, count-only marker (to free space on the map) or nothing at all. When hovering over a count-only marker, the corresponding thumbnail is displayed. A count-only marker behaves the same way as a normal image thumbnail, in terms of color coding, scrolling, drag and drop etc. You can also cycle through these options by pressing Shift+S.
