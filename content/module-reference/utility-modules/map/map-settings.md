# module controls

map source
: Choose the mapping provider to source map information from.

show OSD
: Choose whether to display the OSD controls on top-left of the center view.

filtered images
: When selected, only the images from the filmstrip are displayed in the center view. If not selected, all images in the current library are displayed as long as the corresponding images have GPS data associated with them (shortcut ctrl-s).

max images
: Controls the max number of displayed thumbnails.

group size factor
: Increase or decrease the size of the area that causes images to be grouped.

min images per group
: The minimum number of images that need to be placed in the same position in order to automatically create an image group for them.

thumbnail display
: Three options are available: image thumbnail, count-only marker (to free space on the map) or nothing at all. When hovering a count-only marker, the corresponding thumbnail is displayed. Count-only marker behaves the same way as normal image thumbnail: color coding, scrolling over, drag and drop... (shortcut shift-s).
