In the locations panel you can create areas or locations and organize them as hierarchical tags. The pipe “|” character can be used to insert a new level, i.e. a group of locations.

A location is shown on as a shape on the map when selected. A location can have the shape of circle, ellipse, square or rectangle (initially a shape will be a square or circle, and it can be made into a rectangle or an ellipse by adjusting the width and/or height of the shape). Each location is an entry of geotagging collection under tagged.

# module controls
