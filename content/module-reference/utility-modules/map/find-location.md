The _find location_ module is used to search for a location on map. You must be connected to the internet to use this feature.

To use this module, type in a place name or address, press `Enter` and a list of results will be shown. `Click` on one of the resulting items and the map will zoom to that location. An outline covering that location or a pin pointing at the location will be displayed. Drag images from the [filmstrip](../shared/filmstrip.md) at the bottom of the screen to their location on the map. The GPS location will be embedded into the image.
