The _find location_ panel is used to search for a place on map. You must be connected to the internet to use this feature.

To use this panel, type in a place or address, press `enter` and a list of results will be shown. `Click` on one of the resulting items and the map will zoom to that location. An outline covering that location or a pin pointing at the location will be displayed. Drag images from the film strip at the bottom of the screen to their location on the map. The GPS location will be embedded into the image.
