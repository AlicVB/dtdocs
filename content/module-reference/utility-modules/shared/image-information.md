This module displays the information embedded within an image's Exif data as well as a number of additional data fields defined by darktable.

When hovering with the mouse over image thumbnails, the module's data is automatically updated to show information about the image currently under the mouse cursor.

When several images are selected and the focus is not on a single image, the module only displays information that is the same for all images. If information is different, the text _\<various values\>_ is displayed instead.

# preferences

The “preferences…” option in the presets menu brings up a dialog with a list of all of the fields that are available for display.

The _visible_ checkbox allows you to choose which fields to display. You can also drag and drop one row at a time to change the display order.

These preferences can be saved as module presets.

Press the module's reset button to make all available information visible and displayed in its default order.
