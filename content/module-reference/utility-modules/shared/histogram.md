Show a histogram of the developed image's light levels. 

In its default state curves for all three RGB color channels are displayed. You can toggle the colored squares to enable or disable specific color channels. A curve button is also provided to toggle between linear, logarithmic and waveform views.

Within the darkroom view you can operate some of the [_exposure_](../../processing-modules/exposure.md) module's controls directly from within the histogram. Left-click towards the right hand side of the histogram and then drag right/left to increase/decrease the exposure. Control the black level by clicking and dragging in a similar manner on the left hand side of the histogram. Double-click to reset exposure parameters.

Scroll the mouse while holding the _Ctrl_ key to change the height of the histogram.
