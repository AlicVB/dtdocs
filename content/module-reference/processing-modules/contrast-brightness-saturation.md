A very basic tool for adjusting the _contrast_, _brightness_ and _saturation_ of an image. Please note that a number of other modules provide much more versatile methods of adjusting these parameters.

All module controls default to a neutral position (zero) and provide the ability to increase or decrease the relevant parameter

_**Note:** This module works in Lab color space and better tools are now availalbe. You are now recommended to use the [color balance rgb](./color-balance-rgb.md) module for these corrections._
