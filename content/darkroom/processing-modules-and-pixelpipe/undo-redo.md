While you are editing your image, darktable records all of your changes to an image in the [history stack](./history-stack.md). Thanks to this recording process it is possible to undo and redo changes to recover a previous editing state. Note that this undo/redo facility is unlimited in the number of steps while editing an image but it is reset each time the darkroom is switched to a new image.

The default key shortcuts are:

```
Ctrl+Z   undo last history modification
Ctrl+Y   redo last undo (does nothing if undo has not been used yet)
```
