The darkroom view is where you develop your images. The center panel contains the image currently being edited.

# zoom

Middle-click on the center panel to zoom to 1:1 and double-middle-click to zoom to 2:1. 

Alternatively you can zoom in and out between 1:1 and "fit to screen" by scrolling with your mouse. Scroll while holding the `Ctrl` key pressed to extend the zoom range to between 2:1 and 1:10.

# export

Images are normally exported using the [export selected](../module-reference/utility-modules/lighttable/export-selected.md) module in the [lighttable](../lighttable/_index.md) view. However, you can also export the current image directly from the darkroom by using the shortcut `Ctrl+E`. The image will be exported using the parameters currently set in the _export selected_ module.
