The darkroom view is where you develop your images.

# zoom

You can use middle-click to zoom to 1:1 and Double-middle-click to zoom to 2:1. 

Alternatively you can zoom in and out between 1:1 and fit-to-screen by scrolling with your mouse. Mouse scrolling while holding the `Ctrl` key pressed gives an extended zoom range between 2:1 and 1:10.

# export

Images are normally exported from the [lighttable](../lighttable/_index.md) view. However, you can also export the current image directly from the darkroom by using the shortcut `Ctrl+E`. The currently-edited image is exported using the parameters currently set in the lighttable's [export selected](../module-reference/utility-modules/lighttable/export-selected.md) module.
