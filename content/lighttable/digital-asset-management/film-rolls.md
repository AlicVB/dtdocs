The basic element for organizing images in darktable is called a film roll â€“ a kind of virtual folder. Whenever you [import](../../module-reference/utility-modules/lighttable/import.md) images from the filesystem, the images are organized in a film roll whose name is derived from the name of their parent folder. Re-importing a folder will add any new images to the existing film roll; images already present in the film roll are not reimported (though the contents of their XMP sidecar files are reloaded into the library database).

**Note:** Importing images in darktable does not physically copy them to another location: _importing images will not back up your files_.
