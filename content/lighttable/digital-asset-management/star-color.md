Star ratings and color labels help you to sort and rank images according to your own criteria. An image's star rating and its color labels can be displayed over thumbnails in the lighttable view and filmstrip module.

# star ratings

You can give a rating from zero to five stars to an image. The quality criteria which lead to a rating are up to you. Whenever you import images, each image receives a default rating which you can define in the [_import_ tab of the _preferences_](../../../preferences-settings/import.md) dialog.  You can also mark an image as “rejected” by clicking the icon or pressing the R key. This will remove all stars. You can reverse the rejection by applying a new star rating.

There are several ways to change a rating. While hovering the cursor over an image thumbnail, you can press a number key _0 – 5_ to define the number of stars, or type R to “reject” an image. This is probably the fastest way to rate your images on first inspection of a film roll.

You can also directly click on the star icons that are overlayed on the thumbnails. Click the x to reject, click the fifth star to get a rating of five stars, etc. Clicking either the x or the first star for a second time resets the image rating to unranked, or zero stars. The latter behavior can be changed in the [_lighttable_ tab of the _preferences_](../../../preferences-settings/lighttable.md) dialog.

To rate multiple images at once, select those images in the lighttable or filmstrip and then press the appropriate shortcut key, or click the desired star rating in the bottom panel of the lighttable view. 	

# color labels

Color labels are another way to sort images, and can be used as an alternative to star ratings or work alongside star ratings. Each image can carry any combination of one or more color labels in red, yellow, green, blue, and purple.

You can set the color labels for a single image by hovering your cursor over the thumbnail and pressing the function keys _F1 – F5_, which correspond with the labels in the order given above.

To toggle the color labels of one or more images, select the desired images in the lighttable or filmstrip and then press the corresponding color button in the bottom panel. To remove all labels from the selected images, press the grey button.
