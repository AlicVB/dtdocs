The lighttable view allows you to view and manage your image collection.

The centre view contains thumbnails of your images -- how they are displayed depends on which [mode](./lighttable-modes/_index.md) you are working in.

While the mouse is over an image thumbnail or images are selected, there are a number of actions you can perform:

```
0 – 5      set the rating of the image 
           if an image has 1 star and you hit the 1 key, the image will become unrated. 
R          reject the image.
F1 – F5    set a color label
Ctrl+C     copy the history stack
Ctrl+V     paste the copied history stack
D          open in darkroom view for developing
W          fully zoom into the image while the key is pressed
Ctrl+W     fully zoom into the image and show areas in focus
```
