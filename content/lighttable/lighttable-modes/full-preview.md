From any of the lighttable modes, you can diplay a fully zoomed preview of the image that is currently under the mouse pointer by pressing and holding down the `W` key. This is useful to more closely inspect an image while rating and selecting images.

Holding down the `Ctrl+W` key fully zooms into the image and also activates a [focus peaking](../../module-reference/utility-modules/shared/focus-peaking.md) overlay to highlight if there are any sharp regions in the image that are in focus. For this tool to work the input image needs to hold an embedded JPEG thumbnail,  which is the case for most raw files.

Sometimes pressing `W` or `Ctrl+W` may not appear to have any effect -- effect â€“ in such cases, `Click` on the image thumbnail and press the corresponding key again.

If you want the full preview to stay in place without having to hold the `W` key, you can use sticky preview mode with `Alt+W` key (no focus peaking) or `Ctrl+Alt+W` (with focus peaking). In sticky preview mode, you can zoom and pan within the image in a similar way to the [culling](culling.md) mode.
