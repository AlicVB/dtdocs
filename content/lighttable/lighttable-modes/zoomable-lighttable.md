The _zoomable lighttable_ mode provides a different way to navigate large collections of images. 

# controls

zoom
: Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out of the lighttable (compared to `Ctrl+scroll` in _filemanager_).
: Zooming the thumbnails does not change the number of thumbnails per row, so the lighttable can exceed the visible area on all sides.

navigate
: Hold down the left mouse button to drag the images around on the lighttable to navigate through your collection.

select
: Select images as in the _filemanager_ mode.

**Hint:** you may find that the images are slow to load when zooming quickly through a large collection. One way to speed up the navigation is to generate a cache containing all the thumbnails using the [`darktable-generate-cache`](../../special-topics/program-invocation/darktable-generate-cache.md) command.
