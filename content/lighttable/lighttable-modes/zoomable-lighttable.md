The _zoomable lighttable_ mode provides an easy and intuitive way to navigate large collections of images. 

If you are trying to find something quickly in a collection, this mode allows you to zoom out so that you can see a large number of thumbnails, then you can move the lighttable around to browse them. When you spot something, you can easily zoom in to check if that is really what you were looking for and, if not, zoom out again and keep looking. An example might be looking for images of a bride at a wedding -- the white dress will standout in the thumbnails. You can search for images with the bride, zoom in, rate or tag them for future processing, zoom out and continue browsing.

Apart from the navigation aspects, the _zoomable_ mode works the same as the _filemanager_ mode.

**Hint:** you may find that the images are slow to load when zooming quickly through a large collection. One way to speed up the navigation is to generate a cache containing all the thumbnails using the [`darktable-generate-cache`](../../special-topics/program-invocation/darktable-generate-cache.md) command.
