This is the default mode for viewing image thumbnails in the lighttable view. Images are displayed in a grid with a fixed number of images per row.

The number of images in each row can be altered using the slider in the bottom panel, or by pressing `Ctrl+scroll` while hovering over the center view. 

You can navigate through the images using the arrow keys (←/→/↑/↓) or by scrolling with your mouse. Press `G` to scroll to the top of the collection, `Shift+G` to scroll to the bottom, and `PageUp`/`PageDown` to scroll up/down by a page.

You can select the image under the pointer by clicking on its thumbnail or by pressing `Enter`. A range of images can be selected by clicking on the first image and then `Shift+clicking` on the last one. Images can be added or removed from a selection by `Ctrl+clicking` on their thumbnails or by pressing `Spacebar`.
