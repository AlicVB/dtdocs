Most changes in the lighttable are recorded and can be reverted to a previous state. This includes modifications to color labels, ratings, geo-localization, tags, metadata, copy/paste of history, or applying a style. Note that the facility to undo/redo actions is unlimited in the number of steps while in the lighttable view, but it is reset each time you switch to a different view.

The default keyboard shortcuts are:

```
Ctrl+Z   undo last modifications
Ctrl+Y   reapply last undone modification (if any)
```
